TODO:
- Setup Heirline
- create telescope finder for keymaps searching by discription rather than key
- the plugin mini-pairs is decent but I might want something more similar to what I am used to
- telescope spell_suggest currently overrides my paste register with my misspelling. I don't want it to do this.
- Figure out how to adjust bash theme to match neovim
